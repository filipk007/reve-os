# Requirements: GTME Lite -- Productized GTM Platform

**Defined:** 2026-03-13
**Core Value:** Prove CW-OS can replace Clay for the $5-10k/mo client segment with a two-pass demo: classify messy data -> research + personalized emails on the winners.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for Phase 1 (demo-ready). Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Skills

- [x] **SKILL-01**: Classify skill normalizes job titles to standard seniority levels (IC/Manager/Director/VP/C-Suite)

- [x] **SKILL-03**: Classify skill outputs structured JSON with original values, normalized values, and per-field confidence scores
- [x] **SKILL-04**: Classify skill uses haiku model tier for cost efficiency

### Enrichment

- [x] **ENRICH-01**: DeepLine integration in `research_fetcher.py` following existing provider pattern
- [x] **ENRICH-02**: Waterfall email discovery via DeepLine (multi-provider fallback)
- [x] **ENRICH-03**: Firmographic enrichment via DeepLine (company size, revenue, tech stack)

### Dashboard

- [ ] **DASH-01**: Batch results page displays all processed rows in a data table
- [ ] **DASH-02**: Table columns are sortable by clicking headers

### Demo

- [ ] **DEMO-01**: Synthetic test CSV of 50 companies with varied data quality (clean + messy + missing fields)
- [ ] **DEMO-02**: Two-pass demo flow works end-to-end: classify -> enrich -> email-gen using Twelve Labs profile

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Signal Product (Phase 2)

- **SIG-01**: Signal classifier skill detects active buying signals from company data

- **SELF-02**: Play forking via dashboard UI
- **SELF-03**: Destination templates for Instantly, Smartlead, HeyReach
- **SELF-04**: Client-facing dashboard view with limited permissions

### Platform (Phase 4)

- **PLAT-03**: White-label dashboard per client
- **PLAT-04**: Template marketplace

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Clay cost comparison calculator | Team knows Clay costs already -- show CW-OS cost only via existing analytics |
| n8n workflow integration | Complementary tool, not part of this build -- integrate later |
| Contact enrichment (DeepLine) | Job title verification + social profiles deferred -- email + firmographic is enough for demo |
| Phone waterfall (DeepLine) | Not needed for email outbound demo |
| CRM read/write | n8n handles CRM sync -- CW-OS does AI + enrichment only |
| Mobile/responsive dashboard | Desktop-first for internal team demo |
| Real client data for testing | Synthetic data is faster and controllable -- validate on real data before actual demo |
