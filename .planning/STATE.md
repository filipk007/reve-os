# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-21)

**Core value:** A user can pick an enrichment function, paste a list of companies into a chat, and watch results stream into a table in real-time.
**Current focus:** Phase 03 — Activity Panel + Results

## Current Position

Phase: 03 (Activity Panel + Results) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 2

## Milestone History

### Milestone 1: Functions Platform (Complete)

- 6 phases, 42 requirements, 18 plans
- Completed: 2026-03-19
- Delivered: Function YAML storage, CRUD API, builder UI, workbench, Clay integration

### Milestone 2: Chat-Powered Enrichment Hub (Active)

- 4 phases, 17 requirements
- Started: 2026-03-21

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- User picks function first, then chats (not AI auto-detection)
- Chat + results table hybrid layout (not pure chat)
- Reuse existing WorkerPool → ClaudeExecutor execution engine
- File-based session storage in data/channels/
- SSE streaming (not WebSocket) — consistent with existing patterns
- Share tokens for client access (reuse portal auth)
- Both internal team and clients will use the chat
- [Phase 01]: Followed DatasetStore pattern for ChannelStore — one JSON file per session in data/channels/
- [Phase 01]: Constructor injection of dependencies (function_store, pool) for ChannelOrchestrator -- no FastAPI Request coupling
- [Phase 01]: Reuse webhook.py utility functions via import for ChannelOrchestrator step execution
- [Phase 01-chat-backend]: Saves pending assistant message before SSE streaming starts for disconnect resilience
- [Phase 01-chat-backend]: Results persisted in finally block via update_message_results regardless of stream outcome
- [Phase 02]: Followed existing SSE streaming pattern for channel message streaming -- buffer-based line parsing consistent with streamFunctionExecution
- [Phase 02]: Activity panel uses hidden lg:flex -- responsive, only visible on large screens per UI-SPEC
- [Phase 02]: Followed use-function-workbench.ts hook pattern for useChat -- consistent with existing codebase conventions
- [Phase 02]: FunctionPicker onSelect auto-creates session -- one action to start chatting
- [Phase 02]: Used bg-[#141416] for assistant bubbles since bg-clay-850 not in Tailwind config -- matches UI-SPEC color
- [Phase 02-chat-frontend-core-ui]: Toast notification when creating new chat without function selected -- guides user to pick function first
- [Phase 02-chat-frontend-core-ui]: Sidebar shortcuts shifted +1 to insert Chat at position 2 -- Chat is primary workflow entry point
- [Phase 03-activity-panel-results]: Derive ResultsTable columns from first done result keys when function has no explicit output definitions
- [Phase 03-activity-panel-results]: CSV filename uses function name slugified for meaningful download names

### Blockers/Concerns
