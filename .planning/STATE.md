# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-21)

**Core value:** A user can pick an enrichment function, paste a list of companies into a chat, and watch results stream into a table in real-time.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — chat-backend

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (chat-backend) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 3

## Milestone History

### Milestone 1: Functions Platform (Complete)

- 6 phases, 42 requirements, 18 plans
- Completed: 2026-03-19
- Delivered: Function YAML storage, CRUD API, builder UI, workbench, Clay integration

### Milestone 2: Chat-Powered Enrichment Hub (Active)

- 4 phases, 17 requirements
- Started: 2026-03-21

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- User picks function first, then chats (not AI auto-detection)
- Chat + results table hybrid layout (not pure chat)
- Reuse existing WorkerPool → ClaudeExecutor execution engine
- File-based session storage in data/channels/
- SSE streaming (not WebSocket) — consistent with existing patterns
- Share tokens for client access (reuse portal auth)
- Both internal team and clients will use the chat

### Blockers/Concerns

- None yet
