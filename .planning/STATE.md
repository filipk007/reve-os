# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-13)

**Core value:** Prove CW-OS can replace Clay for the $5-10k/mo client segment with a two-pass demo: classify messy data, research + enrich the winners, personalized emails out.
**Current focus:** Phase 3 complete -- ready for Phase 4 (Demo Flow)

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 4 (Batch Results Dashboard) -- COMPLETE
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase (COMPLETE)
Status: Phase 3 complete, Phase 4 remaining
Last activity: 2026-03-13 -- Completed 03-02-PLAN.md (Confidence coloring + email preview)

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Classify uses haiku tier for cost efficiency (pennies per row)
- DeepLine for waterfall enrichment (one API replaces 5-6 providers)
- Twelve Labs as demo client (profile already exists)
- Synthetic test data over real data (faster, controllable quality variance)
- [Phase 01]: No context loading for classify -- pure data normalization skill
- [Phase 01]: 15 industry verticals (14 named + Other) for B2B coverage
- [Phase 02]: HTTP API only for DeepLine (no CLI) -- VPS doesn't have CLI installed
- [Phase 02]: 60s timeout for email waterfall, 30s for company enrichment
- [Phase 02]: Multi-path response extraction handles provider variance in DeepLine responses
- [Phase 03]: Reuse SpreadsheetView wholesale for batch results (sorting, filtering, CSV export already implemented)
- [Phase 03]: Pass empty arrays for originalRows/csvHeaders since batch results page has no original CSV context
- [Phase 03]: Backward-compatible onRowClick prop -- /run page uses inline expansion, /batch-results uses side panel
- [Phase 03]: Dual confidence field support (confidence_score + overall_confidence_score) for different skill outputs
- [Phase 03]: BatchHistory component replaces empty state on /batch-results landing page
